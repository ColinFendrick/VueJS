## Why Vue as opposed to React/Angular?

- Smaller than other frameworks
- Better runtime performance

## Vue instances control their own template of code that they then output to the screen

- `el` controls which html element is selected
- `data` has custom data object which can be accessed in the controlled html
- `this` is scoped magically to the top of the data

## Commands
- passed to elements for when they are instantiated through the `method` attribute of the new Vue object
